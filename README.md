# Moodle Learning Android App

developed an Android application like moodle system for courses and lectures.

The user can register in-app if he is a teacher or student and every user has their own features and role.

The teacher can add, edit, remove courses and add, edit, and remove lectures inside these courses, and inside every lecture can see the lecture viewers and assignments that are delivered and he received a notification when anyone subscribes to his courses.

The student can subscribe to courses, talk with others in course chat, read lectures and deliver his assignments.

Both users can view their profiles and edit them.

I'm using in this project:
Kotlin , Room Database , Coroutines ,Flow , Navigation Component , MVVM architecture , View Model , Dagger-Hilt , Jetpack-Datastore ,Dependency-Injection , firebase firestore , firebase realtime database, firebase storage
